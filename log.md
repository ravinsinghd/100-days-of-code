# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Aug 13, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Read about linked list in wikipedia.Need to implement that in C++

**Thoughts**.

**Link(s) to work**

### Day 2: Aug 14, wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Read more on linked list. Also tried rust basics.

**Thoughts**. C++ seems to be very complicated to compile in windows.So decided to continue in rust. But seems to be
complicated for implementing linked list due to owner concept. So will go through rust basics.
